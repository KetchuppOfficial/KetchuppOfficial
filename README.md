### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm 1st year student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

Now I'm on the 2nd part of the course in programming by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32) that he runs in MIPT for 1st year students. Here are the best projects of mine written in C and assembley language:

- [Stack](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Stack)

- [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)

- [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)

- [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)

- [My own printf (aka "ParaPF")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/ParaPF)

- [Hash table with optimizations](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Hash_Table)

- [Binary Translator](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Binary_Translator) (developing in progress)

- [My own programming language]() (still undone)

I also have a repository for the reports on laboratory works:

- [Labs_In_General_Physics](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Labs_Semester_2)
