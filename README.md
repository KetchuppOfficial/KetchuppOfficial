### Hi there 👋

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm a 5th year student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics
and Technology).

My [CV](/CV.pdf).

I have a bachelor's degree with honors in applied mathematics and physics from MIPT. As of this
moment I'm studying for a master's degree.

While studying for a bachelor's degree I took some courses in programming and its applications. Here
are the best projects of mine:

- One-year course in C and assembly by [I.R.Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32) (1st year):
  - [Binary Translator](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Binary_Translator)
  - [Hash table with optimizations](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Hash_Table)
  - [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)
  - [My own printf (aka "ParaPF")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/ParaPF)
  - [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)
  - [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)
- One-year course "Uses and applications of C++ language" by
[K.I.Vladimirov](https://github.com/tilir) (2nd year):
  - [Threaded splay tree](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Splay_Tree)
  - [Augmented red-black tree](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Tree)
  - [Triangles](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Triangles_Intersection)
  - [Matrix](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Matrix)
  - [Caches](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/LFU_Cache)
- Semester course in CPU simulation (4th year):
  - [RISC-V functional simulator](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/YARVS)
- Semester course in CPU microarchitecture basics (4th year):
  - [In-order RISC-V pipeline](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/RVCAM)
