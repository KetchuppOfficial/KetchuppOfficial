### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm 1st year student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

During the 1st semester I completed 7 projects by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32). Here are the best ones:

- [Stack](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Stack)

- [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)

- [Double linked list](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/List)

- [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)

- [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)

- [My own programming language]() (still undone)

Now the 2nd semester is in progress. I have already completed 3 projects on assembler. Here they are in chronological order:

- [Frame](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Frame)

- [String functions](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/String-functions)

- [Resident frame](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Resident_Frame)

- [Printf](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/ParaPF) (incomplete)

I also have a repository for the reports on laboratory works:

- [Thermodynamics: 2nd semester](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Labs_Semester_2)
