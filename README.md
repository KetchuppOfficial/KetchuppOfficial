### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm 1st year student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

During the 1st semester I completed a number of projects by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32). Here they are in chronological order:

- [Quadratic equation solver](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Quadratic_Equations)

- [Strings sorter (aka "Onegin" or "Hamlet")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Hamlet)

- [Stack](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Stack)

- [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)

- [Double linked list](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/List)

- [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)

- [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)

- My own programming language (still undone)

During the 2nd semester, that I hasn't finished yet, I completed only two projects on assembler. Here they are in chronological order:

- [Frame](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Frame)

- [String functions](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/String-functions)
