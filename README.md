### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm first year student in MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

During the first semester I completed a number of projects by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32) but the best project is:

[Virtual processor with my own assembler](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)
