### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm 2nd year student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

I've finished one-year course in programming by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32). Here are the best projects of mine written in C and assembly language:

- [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)

- [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)

- [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)

- [My own printf (aka "ParaPF")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/ParaPF)

- [Hash table with optimizations](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Hash_Table)

- [Binary Translator](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Binary_Translator)

Now I'm taking a course "Uses and applications of the C++ language" by [K.I.Vladimirov](https://github.com/tilir).

I also have a repository for the reports on laboratory works:

- [Labs In General Physics](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Labs_In_General_Physics)
