### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I've finished the 2nd year at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology). My [CV](/CV.pdf).

I've finished one-year course in programming by [I.R.Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32). Here are the best projects of mine written in C and assembly language:

- [Binary Translator](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Binary_Translator)

- [Hash table with optimizations](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Hash_Table)

- [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)

- [My own printf (aka "ParaPF")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/ParaPF)

- [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)

- [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)

I've also took course "Uses and applications of C++ language" by [K.I.Vladimirov](https://github.com/tilir).
Here are my best C++ projects:

- [Triangles](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Triangles_Intersection)

- [Augmented red-black tree](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Tree)

- [Matrix](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Matrix)

- [Caches](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/LFU_Cache)

I also have a repository for the reports on laboratory works:

- [Labs In General Physics](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Labs_In_General_Physics)
