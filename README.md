### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dolgov Alexander Alexeyevich. I'm 1st year student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

Now I'm on a 2nd part of the course in programming by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32) that he runs in MIPT for 1st year students. Here are the best projects of mine written in C and assembler:

- [Stack](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Stack)

- [Virtual processor with my own assembler (aka "Processor")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Processor)

- [Binary tree (aka "Akinator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Akinator)

- [Derivative calculator (aka "Differentiator")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Differentiator)

- [My own printf (aka "ParaPF")](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/ParaPF)

- [My own programming language]() (still undone)

I also have a repository for the reports on laboratory works:

- [Thermodynamics: 2nd semester](https://github.com/KetchuppOfficial/Labs_Semester_2)
